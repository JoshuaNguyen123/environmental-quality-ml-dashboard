  # EU annual mean limit: 40 µg/m³
  # WHO guideline: 25 µg/m³ (annual), 200 µg/m³ (1-hour)
  # Using 75th percentile as demonstration threshold for balanced classification
  regulatory_threshold: 120  # µg/m³ — adapted for balanced binary classification
  description: "NO2(GT) > 120 µg/m³ flags elevated pollution event"
